## Introduction

With the increasing development of mixed reality (MR) technology and available devices, the number of its purposes and applications in vehicles and for road users increases. Mixed reality may help to increase road safety, allow drivers to perform non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), and enhance passenger experiences. Additionally, helmet-mounted displays (HMDs) for cyclists could leverage MR to augment cyclists' vision and contribute to road and pedestrian safety. MR can also be helpful in the transition toward automated driving. However, there are still a number of challenges with the use of MR when applied in vehicles, and also several human factors issues need to be solved. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) has the potential to immerse passengers in virtual worlds and contributing to joyful passenger experiences. Current MR research usually focuses on one user at a time and at one point of the reality-virtuality continuum.  

In this workshop, we will discuss the potentials and constraints as well as the impact, role, and adequacy of MR in driving applications and simulations, including multi-user MR experiments, transitional interfaces, and HMDs for cyclists. The primary goal of this workshop is to set a research agenda for the use of MR in intelligent vehicles and for cyclists within the next 3 to 5 years and beyond.

## Call for Papers (Submission of reflection statements, ideas, and more)

The target audience for this workshop are researchers and practitioners in the Automotive UI/HCI community, who are interested to bring forward the field of AR and VR in driving and cycling applications. We invite researchers interested in this workshop to submit reflection statements to the workshop organizers.

## Workshop Details

Attendance: Hybrid, i.e., both in presence and virtual via Zoom and Miro

Duration: Half-day (approx. 4 hours)

Start: TBD

Schedule:

- 15 min | Welcome, introduction round, and presentation of workshop goals.
- 30 min | Pre-recorded videos and on-site presentation of ideas/reflection statements; Feedback.
- 60 min | Session 1: Brainstorming and discussions on MR use cases in the automotive context, identifying challenges and opportunities according to our main goals.
- 15 min | Coffee break. 
- 60 min | Session 2: Brainstorming and discussions in groups. Each group will cover one of the main goals (transitional interfaces, multi-user MR, MR support for cyclists).
- 30 min | Session 3: Brainstorming and collaborative sketching in groups. Participants will get to design/sketch MR
applications. The outcome will be presented by each group followed by an engaging discussion.
- 15 min | Presentation of group discussions.
- Wrap-up and closing.

## Organizers

- Andreas Riegler is senior user experience researcher at University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria and HCI researcher and lecturer at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI), Germany. His research interests include windshield displays and human factors in driver-vehicle interfaces in automated driving. Further, he led the development and open-source release of a VR driving simulator \cite{riegler2019vrdrivingsim, riegler2019virtual} used for user studies in human-computer interaction to explore novel in-vehicle user experiences.
- Andreas Riener is professor for Human-Machine Interaction and Virtual Reality at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI) with co-appointment at the CARISSMA Institute of Automated Driving. In 2017, he founded the interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction Group. His research interests include HF/ergonomics, adaptive UIs, driver state assessment, and trust/acceptance/ethics in automated driving. Andreas is steering committee co-chair of ACM AutomotiveUI and chair of the German ACM SIGCHI chapter.
- Philipp Wintersberger is researcher at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), Austria. His research interests include trust in automated driving, intelligent user interfaces, and human-machine cooperation.
- Tamara von Sawitzky is researcher and lecturer at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Germany. Her research focuses on supporting cyclists through helmet-mounted AR interfaces to increase their situational awareness and (perceived) safety on the road.
- Ye Eun Song is a research assistant at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Germany and a master student at THI since 2021. Her research interests include user research in automated driving. Her current research is addressing the user journey of AR windshield displays in a VR simulator.
