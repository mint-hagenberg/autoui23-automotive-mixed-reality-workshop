## Introduction

With the increasing development of mixed reality (MR) technology and available devices, the number of its purposes and applications in vehicles and for road users increases. Mixed reality may help to increase road safety, allow drivers to perform non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), and enhance passenger experiences. Additionally, helmet-mounted displays (HMDs) for cyclists could leverage MR to augment cyclists' vision and contribute to road and pedestrian safety. MR can also be helpful in the transition toward automated driving. However, there are still a number of challenges with the use of MR when applied in vehicles, and also several human factors issues need to be solved. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) has the potential to immerse passengers in virtual worlds and contributing to joyful passenger experiences. Current MR research usually focuses on one user at a time and at one point of the reality-virtuality continuum.  

In this workshop, we will discuss the potentials and constraints as well as the impact, role, and adequacy of MR in driving applications and simulations, including multi-user MR experiments, transitional interfaces, and HMDs for cyclists. The primary goal of this workshop is to set a research agenda for the use of MR in intelligent vehicles and for cyclists within the next 3 to 5 years and beyond.

## Call for Papers (Submission of reflection statements, ideas, and more)

The target audience for this workshop are researchers and practitioners in the Automotive UI/HCI community, who are interested to bring forward the field of AR and VR in driving and cycling applications. We invite researchers interested in this workshop to submit reflection statements to the workshop organizers.

| 30 min | Pre-recorded videos and on-site presentation of ideas/reflection statements; Feedback.                                                                                                                  |
| 60 min | Session 1: Brainstorming and discussions on MR use cases in the automotive context, identifying challenges and opportunities according to our main goals.                                               |
| 15 min | Coffee break.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 60 min | Session 2: Brainstorming and discussions in groups. Each group will cover one of the main goals (transitional interfaces, multi-user MR, MR support for cyclists).                                      |
| 30 min | Session 3: Brainstorming and collaborative sketching in groups. Participants will get to design/sketch MR applications. The outcome will be presented by each group followed by an engaging discussion. |
| 15 min | Presentation of group discussions.                                                                                                                                                                      |
